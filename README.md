# ward: ward 'aint ready for drawing

No-nonsense infinite whiteboard. This lacks custom brushes, layers, saving. 
Allows pan/zoom, pen colors, pen thickness, erasers, infinite undo. Supports
styluses using the [EasyTab](https://github.com/ApoorvaJ/EasyTab) library, and
renders with reasonable performance using Skia.
