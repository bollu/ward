# ward: ward 'aint ready for drawing

No-nonsense infinite whiteboard. This lacks custom brushes, layers, saving. 
Allows pan/zoom, pen colors, a single pressure sensitive thickness, erasers, infinite undo. Supports
styluses using the [EasyTab](https://github.com/ApoorvaJ/EasyTab) library, and
renders with reasonable performance using SDL2+Skia+ Maybe OpenGL if necessary.
Will probably need to organise rendering data using some kind of spatial partitioning to cull.
